        This template is strictly used for documentation requests, including:

        - Elaborating on a particular topic;
        - Updating external links;
        - Anything else that doesn't require touching the codebase itself.

        If you followed the documentation but things don't work, take some time to consider if it's the documentation or the code that's wrong. In the latter, prefer using the "bug" template.

        You may proceed directly to sending a pull request without filing this issue, and we can improve your work. If you think some of the requirements above are not met, or if you are not able to contribute yourself, the issue is still welcomed.
